      <description>Why we need HPC HPC means High Performance Computing. After A semester of using KVM, I have a feeling that not everyone needs a system, not meaning that they do not need a operation system, what I mean is that when they are working on their FYP or their research, they do not want to set up a enviornment especially they do not want to change their workflow. Therefore, they need a station that they can submit their task, and get their output or result few moments later.</description>
